      "\n",
      "  Client:\n",
      "   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things\n",
      "   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\n",
      "   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\n",
      "   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\n",
      "   other users.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\n",
      "   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\n",
      "   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\n",
      "   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\n",
      "\n",
      "    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\n",
      "\n",
      "    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\n",

      "\n",
      "    o Event Handler Registration:\n",

      "        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\n",

      "        any initialization you want to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "    o Provide a positionObject function:\n",
      "        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\n",
      "\n",
      "    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\n",
      "        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\n",

      "    o Provide a getWorldType function:\n",
      "        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\n",
      "\n",
      "    o Provide an animateWorld function:\n",
      "        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\n",

      "\n",
      "PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many\n",

      "advantage of a 3D extension to X called \"PEX\".  PEXlib is a slightly\n",

      "\n",
      "Some advantages of using PEXlib...\n",
      "- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS\n",
      "- Provides immediate mode capabilities\n",
      "- Is free of \"policy\"\n",
      "- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support\n",
      "  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).\n",
      "  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some advantages of using PHIGS...\n",
      "- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones\n",
      "- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output\n",
      "- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier\n",
      "- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you\n",
      "- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like\n",

      "algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\n",
      "difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\n",
      "algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\n",

      "dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\n",
      "the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n",
      "\n",
      "Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n",
      "+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\n",
      "over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\n",
      "is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\n",
      "expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\n",
      "somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\n",
      "by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\n",
      "constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\n",

      "[1]  What is JPEG?\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized image compression mechanism.\n",
      "JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the\n",
      "committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either\n",
      "full-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\n",
      "It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\n",
      "drawings.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\n",
      "handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\n",
      "of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\n",
      "respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\n",
      "quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\n",
      "of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\n",
      "the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\n",
      "of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\n",
      "be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\n",
      "small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\n",
      "invisible to the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\n",
      "adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\n",
      "off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\n",
      "files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\n",
      "archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\n",
      "aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\n",
      "can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[2]  Why use JPEG?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n",
      "24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\n",
      "networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n",
      "2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\n",
      "disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\n",
      "size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\n",
      "convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\n",
      "with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\n",
      "than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\n",
      "JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\n",
      "store or transmit an image more cheaply.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\n",
      "time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\n",
      "extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\n",
      "posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n",
      "(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\n",
      "only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\n",
      "to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\n",
      "black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\n",
      "in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\n",
      "people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\n",
      "more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\n",
      "GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\n",
      "things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\n",
      "gray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\n",
      "similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\n",
      "hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n",
      "\n",
      "GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\n",
      "such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\n",
      "that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\n",
      "by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\n",
      "introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n",
      "(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\n",
      "should be avoided in JPEG files.)\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\n",
      "adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\n",
      "come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\n",
      "sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\n",
      "often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\n",
      "particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\n",
      "If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\n",
      "scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\n",
      "subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\n",
      "The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n",
      "\n",
      "Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\n",
      "You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\n",
      "images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\n",
      "of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\n",
      "should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n",
      "(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\n",
      "applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\n",
      "a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\n",
      "can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\n",
      "converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\n",
      "If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\n",

      "\n",
      "    Artists, designers, scientists, engineers and educators share the\n",
      "    problem of moving information from one mind to another.\n",
      "    Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,\n",
      "    music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing\n",
      "    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\n",
      "    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\n",
      "    exceed their technical skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\n",
      "    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\n",
      "    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\n",
      "    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\n",
      "    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\n",
      "    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\n",
      "    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\n",
      "    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\n",
      "    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\n",
      "    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\n",
      "    composing imagery for understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\n",
      "    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\n",
      "    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\n",
      "    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\n",
      "    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\n",
